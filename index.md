**I am an independent research scholar and reporter working on natural hazards and conservation in the Eastern Himalayas.** I am a trained zoologist and geographer, with expertise in the zoology and geography of the Eastern Himalaya, particularly Arunachal Pradesh. Since 2007 I have led teams for scientific and conservation projects such as the Indian Savanna Project and the Eaglenest Biodiversity Project. Over the last few years I have brought to fore the risk of natural hazards to the Eastern Himalayas, through hazard reporting, public engagement and ongoing scientific research. 

My recent scientific publication on the rapid decline in forest cover in Arunachal Pradesh has helped conservation leaders make a strong legal case to firmly implement the ban on logging in India. 


I am currently based in Bengaluru, India, from where I work on deforestation reports, natural hazard awareness and crises mapping.

I have co-developed **GeoRaster** and **GeoUtils**, two Python packages for working with geographic rasters and vectors. Take a look at the [blog post](georaster-released), [documentation](http://georaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geoutils/georaster) for more details.
